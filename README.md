# 📊 Time Series Forecasting with Darts and XGBoost

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project explores various methods for time series forecasting using the **Darts** library and **XGBoost**. The goal is to effectively forecast future values by analyzing historical data, identifying seasonality, and leveraging machine learning models.

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```
├── forecast.ipynb              # Jupyter Notebook with all code and analysis
├── data/                       # Folder for datasets (if applicable)
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## 📂 Key Features
1. **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and visualize trends using Pandas and Matplotlib.
   - Applied statistical tests like ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) to check for stationarity.

2. **Seasonality & Decomposition**  
   - Used tools like `seasonal_decompose` to analyze seasonal components.
   - Plotted autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions to identify lag patterns.

3. **Forecasting Models**  
   - **Baseline Model**: Utilized the Darts library for initial forecasting using built-in statistical models.
   - **XGBoost**: Trained a gradient boosting model for enhanced forecasting, capturing complex relationships in the data.

4. **Evaluation & Metrics**  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess forecast accuracy.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib darts xgboost statsmodels openpyxl
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd time-series-forecasting
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook forecast.ipynb
    ```
3. Run the cells sequentially to explore data analysis, model training, and forecasting.

## 💡 Results & Insights
- The **Darts** models provided a quick baseline forecast.
- **XGBoost** outperformed traditional methods, capturing non-linear patterns and improving accuracy.
- The project demonstrated effective ways to enhance time series forecasting using a combination of traditional statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.
